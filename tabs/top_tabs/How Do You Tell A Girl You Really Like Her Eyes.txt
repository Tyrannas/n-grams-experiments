How do you tell a girl you want to talk to her for hours?
Without sounding like the biggest, dumbest coward?
Oh oh ooh oh, Oh oh oh
And I'll take a shower maybe then I'll feel real nice,
Won't buy you flowers unless they're the discount price,
Oh oh ooh oh, Oh oh oh
I can change I can change I can change, I can change
I can change I can change I can change, I can change
How do you tell a girl you really like her eyes?
She had two accidentally tell her twice
Oh oh ooh oh, Oh oh oh
And I'll take a shower maybe then I'll feel real nice,
Fish for words,
I will fish for your thoughts
I can change I can change I can change, I can change

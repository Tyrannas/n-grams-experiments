    D
He's pining for her
      F#m
In a people carrier
               Em
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
    A7
But architecture won't do

            D
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
        F#m
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
         Em
It don't say the funny things she does
           A7
Don't even try and cheer him up, because
              D
It just won't happen

[Verse 2]

           D
He's got the feeling again
             F#m
This time on the aeroplane
               Em
There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front
    A7
But Rodney and Del won't do

            D
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
              F#m
Laugh when he falls through the bar, but you're feeling the same
           Em
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
             A7
She won't be waiting for you when you land


[Middle-Eight]

                   Bm         G
It feels like she's just nowhere near
          Bm             G
You could well be out on your ear
                        Bm               E
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
         G           F#m
And the thought of it
          Em      A7
Makes you feel a bit ... ill

[Verse 3]

 D
Yesterday I saw a girl
    F#m                                   Em
Who looked like someone you might knock about with
           A7
And almost shouted
           D
And then reality kicked in within us
   F#
It seems as we become the winners
    Em
You lose a bit of summat
         A7                   N.C.
And half wonder if you won it at all

                    Bm                  G
And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea
 Bm               G
And she's still nowhere near
                           Bm               E
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
         G           F#m
And the thought of it
          Em       A7
Makes you feel a bit ... ill

   D              Em
Despair in the departure lounge
     F#m                   G   F#m      Em
It's one and they'll still be around at three
                     A7
No signal and low battery

What's happened to me?

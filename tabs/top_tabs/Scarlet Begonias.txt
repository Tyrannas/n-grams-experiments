  E                                         B    A
As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square

      E                                          B   A
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
A                E  B     A                  E
From the other direction, she was calling my eye,
A                E B     A                   E                  B
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try.

 E                                                    B   A
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes.
 E                                                B   A
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
A                 E    B    A                E 
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
A                  E    B   A               E              B
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.
    E                                                   B   A
In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough,
   E                                            B  A
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
A                  E   B   A                   E   
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door,
A                  E   E    A                 E                B
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before.

        F#
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong.
B                           A         E
Seldom turns out the way it does in a song.
F#m
Once in a while you get shown the light
       B                          A          E
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.

[Bridge Riff]
E                                                      B   A  
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves,
E                                          B  A
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
A                    E   B     A                       E 
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes,
A                    E   B     A            E                 B     
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by

E                                               B   A
The wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two";
E                                        B A
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue,
A                  E     B    A                  E 
Strangers stoppin' strangers just to shake their hand,
A                  E     B    A            E                   B 
Everybody's playinâ€™ in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.

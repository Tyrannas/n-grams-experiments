         Big Time Nashville Star (Feat. Esme Patterson) - Shakey Graves
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the song is played in out-right chords with embellishments, standard for most Shakey Graves songs.
For the purposes of this tab I'll first include the embellishments featured prominently between the opening 
chorus and first verse, followed by the chords. The rhythm is somewhat consistent, though Shakey will switch
it up during different sections, depending on what version you watch or hear - but for the most part he plays
a classic country rhythm hitting the low E bass note, playing the chord twice, then doing the same with the 
bass note on the D string. He/they open with a chorus, which you can play with or without chords, followed by
what is essentially the intro. During the intro Shakey plays the following lines of lead based on the E major
chord that he is playing for rhythm:

Each of these is played very quickly and timing can be determined pretty easily from 
listening to the recording.

The chords are as follows:

CHORUS (the last line starts on B and features a walk-down in the bass note)

A           C#m      E  
  You might wander far

B                        A

 Still it never hurts

B    B/A      B/G#    B/F#  E
Even when you do your worst        


Each chord in the last line should look like:

    B       B/A      B/G#     B/F#      E
e|--0--------0--------0--------0--------0--------|

  Right by the way - side

REPEAT (Choruses change lyrics as well)



CLOSING NOTE:
Shakey tends to play his songs a little different each time he plays them, so feel free to break the mold on 
embellishments and lead lines - these are just how I have played them based on the recordings. Thanks for
checking out my tab, and I hope it wasn't too complex or poorly explained, this is my first one, so please 
rate! Shine on

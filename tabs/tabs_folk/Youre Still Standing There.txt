vers.
I've spent my life following things I cannot see
And just when I catch up to them, they slip away from me
I've been down a thousand trails I've never walked before
And I found out that without fail, they lead me to your door

ref.
And the world keep turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there

(here it's the same chords as the vers)

vers.
Lately I see all the signs, I feel it in the wind
The same thing happens every time that you come back again
I admit that there are nights when I sit up and cry
But sometimes I turn out the lights and pray you'll pass me by

ref.
And the world keep turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there

(here it's the same chords as the vers)

Since you're gone my empty arms have nothing left to hold
And your memory cannot keep me warm but it never leaves me cold

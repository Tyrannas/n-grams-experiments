Time Has Told Me
Nick Drake
Standard Tuning

I really do apologize for the state of this tab. It could be cleaned up; made "pretty". 
It really just hit me one night to learn this amazing song and I could not find 
tabs anywhere. So, I wrote up this sketch of what I imagine the song to be. 
Its not accurate in any way other than giving someone the FEEL of the song
rather than how to play it.

This is also my first tab I've put up so, please, be gentle.

Verse:
        Time has told me
        You're a rare rare find
        A troubled cure
        For a troubled mind.

        And time has told me
        Not to ask for more
        Someday our ocean
        Will find its shore.

Bridge:

        So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
        What I really don't want to be
        Leave the ways that are making me love
        What I really don't want to love.

Verse:
        Time has told me
        You came with the dawn
        A soul with no footprint
        A rose with no thorn.

        Your tears they tell me
        There's really no way
        Of ending your troubles
        With things you can say.

        And time will tell you
        To stay by my side
        To keep on trying
        'til there's no more to hide.

Bridge:
        So leave the ways that are making you be
        What you really don't want to be
        Leave the ways that are making you love
        What you really don't want to love.
Verse:
        Time has told me
        You're a rare rare find
        A troubled cure
        For a troubled mind.
        
        And time has told me
        Not to ask for more
        For some day our ocean
        Will find its shore.

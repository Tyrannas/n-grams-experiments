you seem    like              a     soldier
        D      Asus             Dadd3     D/F#2

     Em                            G(Bar)        Em
You're wounded          and play a waiting game,
   Em            G(Bar)               D
In no-man's     land no-one's to blame,
         D/F#2               D            D/F#2
See the world       find an old fashioned girl
          D                  D/F#2
And when all's been said and done
          E                             G(Bar)
It's  the  things  that  are  given, not won
                            D      D/F#2     D     D/F#2
Are the things that you want

Day to day
Where do you want to be?
'cause now you're trying to pick a fight
With everyone you need

You seem like a soldier
Who's lost his composure
You're wounded and play a waiting game
In no-man's land no-one's to blame

See the world
Find an old fashioned girl
And when all's been said and done
It's the things that are given, not won
Are the things that you want

Empty handed, surrounded by a senseless scene
With nothing of significance
Besides a shadow of a dream
You sound like an old joke
You're worn-out, a bit broken
Asking me time and time again
When the answer's still the same

See the world
Find an old fashioned girl
And when all's been said and done
It's the things that are given, not won
Are the things that you want

You've got a chance to put things right
So how's it going to be?
Lay down your arms now
And put us beyond doubt
So reach out it's not too far away
Don't mess around now, don't delay

His Guitar is tuned up +40 semitones 
to be in tune with the accordion
so either tune up +40 semitones (chromatic tuner)
or tune down if you have high string tension
and have that note be +40 semitones and have
capo at fret 1 (tuning still standard just in key with accordian)

Chords

G---C----------G---------F#mi-G--------  &lt;-- if you wanna follow with bass notes (you can also be lazy and
                                                                                  just play these as chords)

Very similar to other tab however changes the bass notes 
there are some live performances on youtube you can check 
out to get better timing and hear it better

Bass Notes

This is what makes this song hard.
In conjunction with the chords this 
is called a poly rhythm (multiple overlaying rhythms)
any way you can totally pick this while playing the 
chords and he does in live solo performances

|-3---3----3-3----2---3---3---3-3----3--|

**
this change is in the middle of the phrase (musical sentence) 
adding another layer to the poly rhythm, I dont really know 
how to explain it, however this change is going to come before
you're "ready" for it so practice this change to get better at the song

Chords X3

Bass notes:
The thunder clouds broke up,
And the rain dried up,
The lightning let up,
The clacking shutters just shut up.

Chords 1/2

2nd half picking part:
There’s no black or white,
No change in the light,
No night, no golden sun.

Picking part:
The sound of cars,
The smell of bars,
The awful feeling of electric heat.

Under fluorescent lights,
There’s sacrifice,
There’s hard feelings,
There’s pointless waste.

ChordsX2
I want wind to blow

Picking part:
My clothes off me,
Sweep me off my feet,
Take me up and bring me back.
Oh, where I can see
Days pass by me,
I have no head to hold in grief.

1st 1/2 of Chord part (accordion part)

2nd 1/2 of Chord part:
There’s no hope for me,
I’ve been set free.
There’s no breeze,
There’s no ship on my sea.

Outro 

****The "Bass notes" are played the whole song till the outro
 &amp;&amp; There are also parts where on the chords he overlays lead lines by 
    doubling voicings (playing the same note on multiple instruments, tracks, multiple octaves)
    So those are pretty easy and can help with your ear!!
 
HAVE FUN I LOVE THIS SONG!!

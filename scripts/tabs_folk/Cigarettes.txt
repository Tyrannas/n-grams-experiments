Just keep repeating this tab and that's the whole song.

Disclaimer:  The only other tab to this song just didn't sound right, so 
I decided to try and make my own. I'm not sure if this is completely 
correct (this is my first time creating tabs), but it is somewhere to 
start if you wish to learn this song.

I created this listening to the song on Russian Red's myspace page.  I 
found that easiest to hear the guitar.

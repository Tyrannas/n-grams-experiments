   G
The papers lie there helplessly,
         G9
 in a pile outside my door,

    C/G
I tried and tried, but I just can't
     G*
 remember what they're for.
      G  
The world outside is tugging like
     C/G        A7/G
 a beggar at my sleeve,
                G*                   C/G               G*
Oh that's much too old a story to believe.
               Gmaj7                           C/G
And you know that it's taken it's share of me,
              Em                                C/G        G**
Even though you take such good care of me .
Gmaj7                                   C/G
Now you say Morocco, and that makes me smile,
                                             G**
I haven't seen  Morocco in a long, long while.
        Gmaj7
The dreams are rolling down across
                          C/G
 the places in my mind,
                                                          G** C/G  G**
And I've just had a taste of something fine.


The future hides and the past just slides,
England lies between,
Floating in a silver mist so cold and so clean.
California's shaking like an angry child will,
Who has asked for love and is unanswered still.
And you know that I'm looking back carefully,
Cause I know that there's still something there for me.
But you said Morocco, and that made me smile,
It hasn't been that easy for a long, long while,
And looking back into your eyes,
 I saw them really shine,
Giving me a taste of something fine,

Something Fine----------------------------

Gmaj7                                  C/G
Now if you see Morocco, I know you'll go in style
                                              G**
I may not see Morocco, for a little while.
        Gmaj7
And while you're there I was hoping you might
C/G
 keep it in your mind,
                                                        G**
to save me just a taste of something fine.

           C/G   G**
